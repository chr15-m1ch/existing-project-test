this is a prototype with a GUI (based on murzatsan)

training:
- done with subset of GTSRB (around 9000 images)
- 8 classes can be detected
- stop, no entry, give way, speed limit 80 and 60, children crossing, keep left and keep right

features:
- recognition in real time
- recognition from videos
- recognition from images

gui:
- allows real time recoginition
- allows choose mp4 file for upload 
- allows choose image for upload


help:
- run the tsr_app.py for the application

- directory subsetGermanDataset contains our dataset for training
- subsetGermanDatasetLabels.csv is the excell file that contains id and name of classes
- training_subset.py trains the model
- germanSubsetModel.p is our result model after training

- classify_subset_real_time.py classifies traffic sign in real time
- classify_subset_video.py classifies traffic signs from videos (not yet completed)
